# Couchbase Lite Extras

These are optional classes that you can use in your apps. They're not built into the library, so if you want to use them you should copy the source files into your project.

### CBLUICollectionSource

This is a data source for a UICollectionView, that's driven by a CBLLiveQuery. In other words it's the collection-view equivalent of CBLUITableSource.
