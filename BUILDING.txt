If you haven't installed GNUstep yet, first follow the steps in SETUP.txt (which is basically a shellscript but you might want to run the lines manually.)

After that you should be able to cd to the TouchDB directory and enter
    make OPTFLAG= debug=yes
to build a debug version of TouchDB including unit tests. The output is "TouchDB.framework".

To run the unit tests, enter
    env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:TouchDB.framework/Versions/Current obj/TouchTool Test_All
which just tells the loader where to find the TouchDB library, then starts the TouchTool binary and tells it to run all the unit tests.

To build a release version (optimized, no unit tests), enter
    make


If you need to debug the GNUstep Base framework, it helps to build and install a non-optimized version of it. To do that:
    cd ~/gnustep-src/gnustep-base
    make OPTFLAG= debug=yes
    sudo -E make install
